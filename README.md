Paint, Global Rain Summary Report, Grazioso Animal Rescue

<b> Paint:</b>

This was an expirimental piece for learning how to set up Eclipse and create a simple Java code.


<b>Global Rain Summary Report:</b>

Includes a pseudocode and flowchart for a dog grooming reservation system as well as a basic explanation of the OOP principles.


<b>Grazioso Animal Rescue:</b>

A Java application demonstrating competancy in Arrays. It was my first multi-class java project. This application intakes dogs and monkeys into a service training program, reserves animals for adoption, prints out all dogs or monkeys, and prints out all animals that are not currently reserved.
